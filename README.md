A simple Python-based YouTube video downloader that allows users to select a download directory via a GUI file dialog and downloads the highest quality video available.

This project uses **yt-dlp** for reliable YouTube extraction and **ffmpeg** for merging audio and video streams, making it far more stable than traditional pytube-based solutions.
